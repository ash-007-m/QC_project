# Simulated Emission Spectrum of Hydrogen Atom using Qiskit

## Overview

This project simulates the emission spectrum of a hydrogen atom by calculating the ground and excited state energies using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm in Qiskit. The code utilizes quantum chemistry principles to construct a Hamiltonian for the hydrogen atom and computes the transition energies and their corresponding emission intensities.

## Requirements

To run this code, you will need the following libraries:

- Qiskit
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install qiskit numpy matplotlib
